Cost Analysis Pic:
This analyzes the cost. 
We want to put the D' in the first or third one since then only two access requirements
	will have an extra node added to them instead of three access reqirements, thus
	the total cost is 2 instead of 3. 
	

Tree structure pic
With duplication, this is a tree and at each level are the different stages of duplication
- At first level, seek time is reduced but redundancy is added by 1
- Same at subsequent levels
- Eventually, all the data units are put together but we have a lot of redundancy. 
Currently, the algorithm goes with reducing seek time if possible and does not consider the impact upon the memory.
